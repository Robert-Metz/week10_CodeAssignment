Stored Procedures:

	A stored procedure is exactly what it sounds like, some form of procedure being enacted in MySQL quickly as it has been stored away for use later.
 
	The pros to this are obviously speed not just in the typing end but also in the load time as the feature basically stores the print out instead of
	having to manually divvy up the information as if you were to just keep copy pasting the same SQL command in the command line.

	The cons to this however are that when there are updates that some of these commands can be rendered obsolete and MySQL doesnt offer a functioning 
	debugging system so sometimes these stored procedures must be dropped and reconfigured with the new information.

	All in all I view these to be a pretty efficient way to navigate database.

Favorite Thing I Learned This Week:

	Besides the fact that we are getting a week off I really enjoy the idea of Stored Procedures, I am learning to leave them to be more encompassing because I
	keep making these LIMIT 20 ends where I later actually want to see all the information I'm getting and I could easily just add a LIMIT 20 after
	typing the stored procedure, so there is also a level of performability and maximization of usage instead of having a massive arsenal of stored 
	procedures it's nice to think of them not as the entire task, but a small piece of a task that can now be a lot less code on the command line 
	which can be an extremely helpful thing when dealing with something that requires so many layers it's nice to know you can toss in something quickly to
	cover the task and know that its functionality won't be in question (if it's been tested seperately of course).
